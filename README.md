**Optimization problem:** Problems those requires minimum or maximum result.
- the solutions those satisfies the constraint of any problem are the feasible solutions.
- there ore only one solution to any optimization problem. 

**Strategies for solving Optimization problems:**
- Greedy methode
- Dynamic Programming 
- Branch and Bound

# Greedy Method
>**<p align="justify">A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage, with the intent of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not usually produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.<p/>**
