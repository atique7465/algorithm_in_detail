# algorithm_in_detail
>**<p align="justify">In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation<p/>**

**Characteristics of an Algorithm:**
- **Unambiguous:** Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps (or phases), and their inputs/outputs should be clear and    must lead to only one meaning.
- **Input:** An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.
- **Output:** An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.
- **Definiteness** 
- **Finiteness:** Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **effectiveness**
- **Feasibility:**  Should be feasible with the available resources.
- **Independent:**  An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code.

**Asymptotic Notations**
- **Big O Notation:** defines an upper bound of an algorithm.
- **Ω Notation:** provides an asymptotic lower bound.
- **Θ Notation:** The theta notation bounds a functions from above and below / average bound.

**Optimization problem:** Problems those requires minimum or maximum result.
- the solutions those satisfies the constraint of any problem are the feasible solutions.
- there ore only one solution to any optimization problem. 

**Strategies for solving Optimization problems:**
- Greedy methode
- Dynamic Programming 
- Branch and Bound

# Greedy Method
>**<p align="justify">A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage, with the intent of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not usually produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.<p/>**
